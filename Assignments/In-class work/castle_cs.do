6.	Estimate the effect of castle doctrine reform using CS.
a.	Specify the model using OR, IPW and DR and compare your results
b.	Specify the model using the never-treated states as controls and then separately the not-yet-treated.  Compare the ATT under both.  Show both the overall-ATT for both as well as the dynamic event study model.  Discuss who is the controls under not-yet-treated.
c.	Using the never-treated, what is the group ATT by treatment date?
